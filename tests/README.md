# Unit Tests for CANELa_NP

So far, the unit tests are only for the calc_ce method in the Nanoparticle class. To run the tests, you need to install pytest. Then, you can run the tests by running the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
pytest
```

The tests make sure the cohesive energy that is calculated with the package matches the values from the paper.
